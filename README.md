Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement
- Strong Password Policy
Set clear rules for creating strong passwords. This includes requiring longer, more complex passwords, preventing reuse, and locking out users after too many failed login attempts.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Ask users to confirm who they are with more than just a password. For example, after typing in a password, they might also enter a code from their phone or use a fingerprint.
- Firewall Setup and Maintenance
Set up firewalls to control which traffic is allowed into and out of the network. Make sure these rules are reviewed and updated regularly to block anything suspicious.


Part 2: Explain your recommendations
- A password policy makes it harder for attackers to guess or reuse passwords. It also stops people from using weak or default ones, which helps fix the issues found in the network.
- MFA protects the system even if someone gets hold of a password. That second layer of security makes it much harder for anyone to log in without permission.
- A firewall acts like a digital gatekeeper. With the right rules in place, it blocks harmful traffic before it can reach the network, helping prevent future attacks.
